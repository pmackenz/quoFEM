    This example illustrates how quoFEM interacts with OpenSeesPy. A simple
    forward propagation procedure is run to estimate the first and second
    central moments of a FE model's response, given the marginal distributions
    of various random parameters.

    This example illustrates how Python scripting can be used with quoFEM to
    express general mathematical models without the use of a dedicated finite
    element analysis engine.

    In this example, a parameter estimation routine is used to estimate column
    stiffnesses of a simple steel frame, given data about it's mode shapes and
    mass distribution.

title: Hierarchical Bayesian Calibration of Material Model Parameters using CustomUQ Engine
summary: |
  In this example, simulated data of the response of a number of steel coupons, subjected to 
  six different strain histories are used to calibrate the the parameters of the STEEL02 
  material model in OpenSees corresponding to each coupon, as well as the parameters of a 
  multivariate normal distribution defining the distribution of the calibrated STEEL02 model 
  parameters across the set of coupons, using Hierarchical Bayesian Calibration. 
  The synthetic data is generated using the STEEL02 model to represent the
  response of steel coupons, where each coupon's material parameters are randomly
  sampled from a multivariate normal distribution.
